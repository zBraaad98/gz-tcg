          </h3>

            3. Grading and Authentication
          </h3>
          <p>
            All graded trading cards sold by GZ-TCG are authenticated and graded
            by independent third-party grading companies. These may include, but
            are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator)</li>

            <li>ACE Grading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            GZ-TCG does not perform grading, authentication, or alteration of
            trading cards. All grading opinions, scores, and encapsulation are
            those of the issuing grading company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Graded cards are sold sealed in their original grading holders and
            are not removed, modified, or altered by GZ-TCG.

        <!-- 4. Product Descriptions -->
        <section>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Product Descriptions</h3>
          <p>
            Product descriptions and images are provided accurately and in good
            faith based on the grading company’s assessment and the condition of
            the item at the time of listing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Minor cosmetic imperfections to grading holders (such as light
            surface marks or scuffs) may occur during the grading or shipping
            process and do not affect the grade of the card.

        <!-- 7. Returns and Refunds -->
        <section>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Returns and Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            Returns and refunds are handled in accordance with the policies of
            the platform through which the item was purchased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of graded collectibles, returns are generally only
            accepted in cases of:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>Items not matching the listing description</li>
            <li>Damage incurred during transit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Buyer’s remorse or disagreement with a third-party grading opinion
            does not constitute grounds for a return.
          </p>
